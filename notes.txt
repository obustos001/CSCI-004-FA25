I imported the array library. 
Now I want to use it.
I signified that "arr1" is the "array[1, 2, 3]"
Once I made an array essentially "named 'arr1'", then I printed "arr1" to make sure I did it correctly. 
And it printed correctly. 

I now made "list100" and signified what it meant.
I used characters and numbers in my list, basially signifing the differnce between a list and an array.
Then I successfully printed my "list100" list. :)
